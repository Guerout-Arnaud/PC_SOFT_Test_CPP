    /**
     * @brief Index Class conating both Key (Word) and Value (LinkedList)
     * @details This class is used as the Key/Value in my Key/Value dictionary.
     *      It contains the values (names of the files where the Word can be find)
     *      as a linked list. This linked list comes from my own C library. It has
     *      been slightly modified to fit C++ compared to [github current version]
     *      (https://github.com/Guerout-Arnaud/C_Lib). I've made this choice to
     *      focus on the main goal of this project: the Dictionary and not lose
     *      time reinventing the wheel by creating a new container. Under normal
     *      circomptences I would have used a std::list. Since I use this library
     *      in most of my project I know this is reliable and memory safe.
     *      Also the use of my Linked List could be made easier and quicker by
     *      using a shared pointer. This would avoid me to make deep copy of the
     *      list. I didn't used smart pointers here because STL containers were
     *      banned so I thought smart pointers could be.
